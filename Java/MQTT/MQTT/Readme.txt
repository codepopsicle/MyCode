In order to run the application, kindly follow the below steps:

1) Extract the ZIP file
2) Open a terminal instance in the project root directory and execute 'gradle task runRegistry' to start the rmiregistry
3) Open another terminal instance in the project root directory and execute 'gradle task runServer' to start server

                        OR
                        
 Steps 2) and 3) can be run together using the command 'gradle task runParallelTasks' so that the rmiregistry and server need not be started separately.
 
4) Open another terminal instance in the project root directory and execute 'gradle task runBoard' to start the configurable information board.
5) Open another terminal instance in the project root directory and execute 'gradle task runClient' to start the client GUI used to add/edit/delete flights
